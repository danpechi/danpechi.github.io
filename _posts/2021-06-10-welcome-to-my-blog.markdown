My goal with this reading blog is two-fold: to enhance my own learning process, and hopefully contribute to othersâ€™ understandings of the topics at hand. I try to link ideas in these papers to concepts in neuroscience as this is the most intuitive way for me to digest them, and I hope framing otherwise hard to parse papers in this way might help others too.
