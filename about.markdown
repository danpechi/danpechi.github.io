Hi! I'm Dan; I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Comlinkdata](https://comlinkdata.com/), a telecom market research firm. I graduated from Tufts in 2019 with majors in Computational Linguistics, Cognitive Brain Science, and a minor in Russian. Previously, I built machine learning products for clients as a Data Science Consultant at Oliver Wyman Digital, and for the government as a Part-Time Software Engineer at Charles River Analytics.

When not modeling the telecom world, I read (predominantly NLP) papers, and write about them here; my previous blog from my undergrad years is [here](https://dandeeplearningblog.wordpress.com/)
